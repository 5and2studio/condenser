# Condenser

Condenser is a config-driven database subsetting tool.

Subsetting data is the process of taking a representative sample of your data in a manner that preserves the integrity of your database, e.g., give me 5% of my users. If you do this naively, e.g., just grab 5% of all the tables in your database, most likely, your database will break foreign key constraints. At best, youâ€™ll end up with a statistically non-representative data sample.

One common use-case is to scale down a production database to a more reasonable size so that it can be used in staging, test, and development environments. This can be done to save costs and, when used in tandem with PII removal, can be quite powerful as a productivity enhancer. Another example is copying specific rows from one database and placing them into another while maintaining referential integrity.

# Config

Configuration must exist in `config.json`. There is an example configuration provided in `example-config.json`. Below we describe the use of all configuration parameters.

*passthrough_threshold*: Integer specifying maximum number of rows a table can contain to be automatically considered as a passthrough table. Leave empty to disable.

*passthrough_tables*: Array of strings of all tables to be passthrough-ed

*dependency_breaks*: An array containg a JSON object with *"parent"* and *"child"* fields of table relationships to be ignored in order to break cycles

*tables*: All tables to consider.  Do not need to replicate passthrough tables in this list.

*desired_result*: JSON object containing a *"table"* and *"percent"* fields to specify desired end result.  Also contains *"required_pks"* an array of primary keys for table that must be included.

*max_tries*: Number of iterations of binary search to find optimal input table size. We recommend 10.

Database configuration must exist in `.destination_db_connection_info` and `.source_db_connection_info`. An example is in `example_db_connection_info`. The password field may be omitted, which will cause the program to prompt for a password.

# To Run
```bash
python main.py
```

# Known Issues

* Only works for Postgres for tables in the "public" schema.

* Only works with bigint, non-compound primary and foreign keys.

# (Optional) Start Docker Container:

This starts a docker container which you can use as a destination database.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To confirm it is running:
```bash
docker ps
```
